I am a second-year PhD student in Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. After passing the qualification exam, I am actively exploring towards high-dimensional statistics, machine learning and other modern topics with their applications in data analysis. 

Before becoming a student in statistics & mathematics, I was an undergraduate major in physics and minor in economics. At that time, I obtained experience as a quantitative researcher (intern) in financial data analysis, and gradualy found my interest in applying and developing mathematical tools in the real-world problems.
